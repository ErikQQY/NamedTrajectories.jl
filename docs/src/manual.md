# Manual

To begin with install the package using the package manager

```julia
] add NamedTrajectories
```

Then load the package

```julia
using NamedTrajectories
```

## Creating a trajectory

A trajectory is a collection of named vectors, each of which has the same length. Mathematically we have a collection of vectors

```math
\qty{z_t = \qty(x_t \\ u_t)}_{t=1:T}
```

The vectors can be of any type, but must be named. The names are used to identify the vectors, and must be unique.

```julia
data = (

) 
```
